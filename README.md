# Square-One
A collection of exercises and guides designed to introduce students to the very
basics of computer programming.

## Prerequisites
- Absolutely no previous knowledge of programming necessary. This guide assumes
you are a complete beginner with nothing more than enthusiasm to learn.
- A recently updated MacBook to which you have administrative access. (A guide
for windows users is in the works, but is not quite ready yet, sorry.)

## How to use this guide
Follow the steps in order and take your time. There is no race and you are the
expert on your own learning abilities and pace. Ensure you have understood each
exercise thoroughly before moving onto the next.

#### Don't give up at the first hurdle
Google everything. Most of programmer's time is spent on researching a problem
and learning how to phrase the perfect google search query. The majority of
the answers to your questions will be found on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), BUT please
refrain from simply copy-pasting the bits that you think will make your code
work: take time to understand what is happening, google further so you have
more than one source of information, and adapt what you have found to suit
your needs.

#### This is not the only way to learn
This collection of materials is not a set-in-stone syllabus: feel free to go
rogue. If you end up down a google rabbit-hole, don't abandon your path because
it's not in this guide. As you progress through the guide, you will realise
which bits interest you most and which will be more useful to you and the
future you have in mind. Curiosity should never be interfered with and all
information will end up being useful to you.

And if, while exploring, you find something (a tutorial or guide) which is so
awesome you think it may benefit other learners, please open a [github issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/)
and let me know.

This guide will be constantly updated and improved, so check back regularly to
find the latest challenges.

## Join the community
Starting out in the industry can feel daunting and isolating, and many newbies
are reluctant to reach out for help (this goes double for women and minorities).
Sadly, they are reluctant for good reason: there are a lot of asshole coders out
there who like to answer newbies' questions derisively (if at all) and humiliate
or bully those they think are "unsuited" out of forums or out of the industry
all-together.

Fortunately, things are turning around and there are more and more companies and
self-regulating groups which are genuinely supportive to anyone who wants to learn
and do not stand for any sort of intimidation. Not every group or online community
is perfect (yet), but the good ones are aware of that and are working to make their
spaces good for everyone.

Here's a selection I suggest checking out:
- [#sq1](https://github.com/fouralarmfire/square-one/blob/master/sq1-slack.md#sq1) -> The dedicated Slack group for newbies following this guide (recommended)
- [#devchat](https://devchat.devolio.net/) -> "a community of developers, asking
and answering questions, solving challenges, and having a good time learning together"
- [#codecommunity](https://thecodeteam.com/community/) -> "The goal of the {code}
Community is to create a safe place for communication and collaboration on open
source projects"
- A comprehensive list of [CoderCommunities](https://www.codercommunities.com), useful
once you have a clearer idea of where you want to take your studies.

### Found something wrong?
Open a [github issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) in this repo including in your report:
1. The step which is incorrect/broken
1. What you tried to do to make whatever the step intended work (I'm assuming
you didn't simply give up at the first sign of a challenge)
