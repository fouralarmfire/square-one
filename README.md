# Square-One
A collection of exercises and guides designed to introduce students to the very
basics of computer programming.

## Prerequisites
- Absolutely no previous knowledge of programming necessary. This guide assumes
you are a complete beginner with nothing more than enthusiasm to learn.
- A recently updated MacBook to which you have administrative access. (A guide
for windows users is in the works, but is not quite ready yet, sorry.)

## How to use this guide
Follow the steps in order and take your time. There is no race and you are the
expert on your own learning abilities and pace. Ensure you have understood each
exercise thoroughly before moving onto the next.

#### Don't give up at the first hurdle
Google everything. Most of programmer's time is spent on researching a problem
and learning how to phrase the perfect google search query. The majority of
the answers to your questions will be found on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), BUT please
refrain from simply copy-pasting the bits that you think will make your code
work: take time to understand what is happening, google further so you have
more than one source of information, and adapt what you have found to suit
your needs.

#### This is not the only way to learn
This collection of materials is not a set-in-stone syllabus: feel free to go
rogue. If you end up down a google rabbit-hole, don't abandon your path because
it's not in this guide. As you progress through the guide, you will realise
which bits interest you most and which will be more useful to you and the
future you have in mind. Curiosity should never be interfered with and all
information will end up being useful to you.

And if, while exploring, you find something (a tutorial or guide) which is so
awesome you think it may benefit other learners, please open a [github issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/)
and let me know.

you didn't simply give up at the first sign of a challenge)
