# Outline

## Level 0
This level is to introduce you to the basics. You will learn how to use your
terminal, how to write a simple terminal shell program, and basic syntax for a
couple of widely-used, beginner friendly programming languages.

1. Prepare your laptop for hacking with the guide [here](https://github.com/fouralarmfire/square-one/blob/master/machine-setup.md#mac-osx-setup).

1. Complete [this](https://try.github.io/) and read [this](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial). From now on, everything you work on should be tracked and published in a git repository.

1. Complete exercises 2 to 15 of [Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/appendixa.html)

1. Complete this [Hello World exercise](https://github.com/fouralarmfire/shell-tutorial/blob/master/osx_and_linux/exercises/hello_world.md#hello-world)

1. Complete [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/)

1. Complete chapters 1.1 to 2.16 of [The Modern Javascript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)

1. Write the following 2 programs. You can do these in Ruby, JS or Shell. Or
even better all three.
	- [Fizzbuzz](https://github.com/fouralarmfire/shell-tutorial/blob/master/osx_and_linux/exercises/fizzbuzz.md#fizzbuzz)
	- [LeapYear](https://github.com/fouralarmfire/shell-tutorial/blob/master/osx_and_linux/exercises/leap_year.md#leap-year)


## Level 1
By the time you start this level, you should have some idea of where you would
like to take your studies. You therefore can chose to narrow your focus (skip
the Ruby stuff and focus on Javascript), carry on building on everything you
began in the previous Level by completing all given steps, or try something
[completely different](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1).

Some of the steps here are tutorials or guides similar to Level 0, some are
links to sites which all coders use to level up by implementing simple programs.
You don't have to follow the steps sequentially, but can have multiple tracks
on the go at the same time.

1. Use your Github account to sign up to [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) and select
the language(s) you want to learn.

1. Use your Github account to sign up for [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) and select
the language(s) you'd like to improve.

1. Use your Github account to sign up to [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

1. Chapters 3.1 onwards of [The Modern Javascript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)

1. Sign up for [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and complete whichever
tracks you are interested in. (n.b. codecademy is not everyone's favourite, but
can be a useful way to practice)

1. Sign up for [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/). This is
a Bioinformatics learning/challenge site, but it is a great way to practice
algorithms. Python is the most used language here, but you can submit your answer
using the whichever you are more interested in learning.
