# Outline

## Level 0
This level is to introduce you to the basics. You will learn how to use your
terminal, how to write a simple terminal shell program, and basic syntax for a
couple of widely-used, beginner friendly programming languages.
At this level, the language is somewhat irrelevant: these initial exercises
are simply designed to get you comfortable working with your computer in a new
way. By the end of Level 0 you should know what to look for in a tutorial for
the language of your choice, and feel confident enough to set up your machine
for it.

1. Prepare your laptop for hacking with the guide [here](https://github.com/fouralarmfire/square-one/blob/master/machine-setup.md#mac-osx-setup).

1. Complete [this](https://try.github.io/) and read [this](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial). From now on, everything you work on should be tracked and published in a git repository.

1. Complete exercises 0 to 15 of [Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/appendixa.html)

1. Complete this [Hello World exercise](https://github.com/fouralarmfire/square-one/blob/master/challenges/hello_world.md#hello-world)

1. Complete [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/)

1. Complete all 19 excercises of [Javascripting](https://github.com/workshopper/javascripting#javascripting)

1. Complete all 13 exercises of [LearnYouNode](https://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers)

1. Complete [Webapps for Beginners](http://webapps-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/index.html)

1. Write the following 2 programs. You can do these in Ruby, Node or Shell. Or
even better, all three.
	- [Fizzbuzz](https://github.com/fouralarmfire/square-one/blob/master/challenges/fizzbuzz.md#fizzbuzz)
	- [LeapYear](https://github.com/fouralarmfire/square-one/blob/master/challenges/leap_year.md#leap-year)


## Level 1
By the time you start this level, you should have some idea of where you would
like to take your studies (or maybe not, but don't worry). You therefore can
chose to narrow your focus (skip the Ruby stuff and focus on Javascript), carry
on building on everything you began in the previous Level by completing all
given steps, or try something [completely different](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1).

Some of the steps here are tutorials or guides similar to Level 0, some are
links to sites which all coders use to level up by implementing simple programs.
You don't have to follow the steps sequentially or even do all of them, but can
click through to see what you feel like doing and even have multiple tracks on
the go at the same time.

But... before you get to the list, the first thing you'll want to do (because
you are a legit hacker now) is [pimp your terminal](http://jilles.me/badassify-your-terminal-and-shell/).

1. Use your Github account to sign up to [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) and select
the language(s) you want to learn.

1. Use your Github account to sign up for [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) and select
the language(s) you'd like to improve.

1. Use your Github account to sign up to [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

1. Carry on with other exercises from [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io/#workshopper-list)

1. [Testing for Beginners](http://testing-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/)

1. [The Modern Javascript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)

1. Sign up for [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and complete whichever
tracks you are interested in. (n.b. codecademy is not everyone's favourite, but
can be a useful way to practice)

1. Sign up for [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/). This is
a Bioinformatics learning/challenge site, but it is a great way to practice
algorithms. Python is the most used language here, but you can submit your answer
using the whichever you are more interested in learning.

1. Learn to [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
