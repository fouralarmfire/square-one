# Outline

## Level 0
This level is to introduce you to the basics. You will learn how to use your
terminal and basic syntax for a couple of widely-used, beginner friendly programming languages.
At this level, the language is somewhat irrelevant: these initial exercises
are simply designed to get you comfortable working with your computer in a new
way. By the end of Level 0 you should know what to look for in a tutorial for
the language of your choice, and feel confident enough to set up your machine
for it.

1. Prepare your laptop for hacking with the guide [here](https://github.com/fouralarmfire/square-one/blob/master/machine-setup.md#mac-osx-setup).

1. Complete exercises 0 to 15 of [Command Line Crash Course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/appendixa.html). _(shell)_

1. Learn [how to to use git to manage projects](https://github.com/fouralarmfire/square-one/blob/master/tutorials/new-project-setup.md#how-to-set-up-and-manage-a-new-project). From now on, everything you work on should be tracked and published in a git repository. _(shell)_

1. Complete exercises 0 to 43 of [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/). _(ruby)_

1. Complete all 19 excercises of [Javascripting](https://github.com/workshopper/javascripting#javascripting). _(javascript)_


## Level 1
By the time you start this level, you should have some idea of where you would
like to take your studies (or maybe not, but don't worry). You therefore can
chose to narrow your focus (skip the Ruby stuff and focus on JavaScript), have a
go at all given steps, or try something completely different like [Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)
or [Python](https://learncodethehardway.org/python/).

Some of the steps here are tutorials or guides similar to Level 0, some are
links to sites which all coders use to level up by implementing simple programs.
They mainly involve Ruby and JavaScript, but similar languages are also listed.
You don't have to follow the steps sequentially or even do all of them, but can
click through to see what you feel like doing and even have multiple tracks on
the go at the same time.

But... before you get to the list, the first thing you'll want to do (because
you are a legit hacker now) is [pimp your terminal](http://jilles.me/badassify-your-terminal-and-shell/).

#### Courses
1. [Webapps for Beginners](http://webapps-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/index.html). _(ruby)_

1. Node Girls' [Node Workshop](https://github.com/node-girls/node-workshop/blob/master/README.md). _(nodejs)_

1. Node Girls' [Express Workshop](https://github.com/node-girls/express-workshop/blob/master/README.md). _(nodejs)_

1. [The Viking Code School Prep Work](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/prep). _(html, css, javascript)_

1. Use your Github account to sign up to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) and learn the basics of web development. _(ruby, javascript, html, css, databases, rails)_

1. [Introduction to Test Driven Development](https://github.com/fouralarmfire/square-one/blob/master/tutorials/fizzbuzz-tdd.md#intro-to-test-driven-development-fizzbuzz). _(python, ruby, nodejs)_

1. Use your Github account to sign up to [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). _(javascript, html, css)_

1. [LearnYouNode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode). _(nodejs)_

1. [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io/). _(nodejs)_

1. Learn to [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). _(python)_

1. Complete exercises 44 to 52 of [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/). _(ruby)_ **skip exercise 47**. (Or if you'd rather switch to Python, you can pay for the "Learn Python the Hard Way" book by the same author.)

1. [The Modern Javascript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/). _(javascript)_

1. Sign up for [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and complete whichever
tracks you are interested in. (n.b. codecademy is not everyone's favourite, and can give
a false sense of confidence since newbies are unaware of just how much magic is
happening in the background to help them along.)

#### Practice, practice, practice

1. Use your Github account to sign up to [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) and select
the language(s) you want to learn.

1. Use your Github account to sign up for [Exercism](http://exercism.io/) and select
the language(s) you'd like to improve.

1. Use your Github account to sign up for [CodingGame](https://www.codingame.com) and
build games while you learn.

1. Sign up for [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/). This is
a Bioinformatics learning/challenge site, but it is a great way to practice
algorithms. Python is the most used language here, but you can submit your answer
using the whichever you are more interested in learning.


## Level 2
This is where is gets tricky. You are not a complete newbie any more, and will
probably roll your eyes at yet another "X for beginners" tutorial. Unfortunately,
there are not many tutorials out there for "I'm ready to get into it for real now".
Now would be a good time to read [this article](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard), and prepare yourself for things
getting tougher.

More steps will be added to this level soon, but for now see how you get on with:

1. Learn how to contribute to Open Source repositories on [Open Source Friday](https://opensourcefriday.com/).

1. Build games, sites and more by editing existing codebases on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).

1. Learn more about [testing your code](http://testing-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/). _(ruby)_

1. Build your own [text-based adventure game](https://github.com/Callisto13/epacseon). _(python)_
