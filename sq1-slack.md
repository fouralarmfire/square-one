# sq1

**note**: this group is newly created so might be a little quiet for a bit... get
in there and make some noise :)

The dedicated Slack group for new coders following this guide.
The perfect place to ask for help, share code, pitch ideas, start study groups,
find a friend etc etc.

[Pair programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/pairing/) is used by many
companies as an alternative to people working alone and then having their code
checked. It is a great way to share knowledge and work on problems together; I
would highly recommend it to beginners.

You are free to create subgroups by topic or interest. By joining sq1 all members

## Rules
Please try to be considerate and help keep learning to code fun by following a
couple of simple rules:
1. In order for people to feel comfortable posting any question they may have,
there has to be a genuine atmosphere of "no question is stupid". This means responding
in a kind and helpful way. No fake surprise: "oh my god I can't believe you don't
know that". No "well, actually". Others who would also value an answer can show
their support by adding :plus-one: emojis to the OP.
1. No douchebraggery: `"Just totally CRUSHED this javascript tutorial. Callbacks are my biatch."`
Instead, try to offer help to those who may still be on it and if they want to talk
some things through. Also, it is very doubtful you crushed it that well and going over
the bits you struggled with again will help you too.
