# Intro to Test-Driven Development: Fizzbuzz

This tutorial now comes in two flavours!

You can choose between [Ruby](https://github.com/fouralarmfire/square-one/blob/master/tutorials/fizzbuzz-rb.md#intro-to-test-driven-development-in-ruby-fizzbuzz) and [Javascript](https://github.com/fouralarmfire/square-one/blob/master/tutorials/fizzbuzz-js.md#intro-to-test-driven-development-in-javascript-fizzbuzz).

Or why not try both?
