# Shell Scripting 101

First of all what is Shell? In a nutshell (ha!), shamelessly ripped off from Wikipedia, shell is:
```
A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the Unix shell,
a command-line interpreter.
The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages.
Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation,
program execution, and printing text.
```
Essentially a shell is a session in your terminal or command prompt (the thing hackers in movies use)
into which you enter commands to make your computer do some exciting things.

A shell script is a program written in a language the shell (terminal) can understand, interpret and execute.
Shell scripting is useful because it saves us from having to type each thing we want to do, line by line, at
the moment we want it.

Instead we can write everything we need to get done in a script, and simply run the program.
